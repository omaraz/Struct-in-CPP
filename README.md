# Struct-in-CPP
This is a simple implementation of struct in c++ using employee data as an example.

This program is just a practice to use the struct, we used the employee as a struct and its data is name, id, and salary.
we create only one object you can make many as you want or array of it, next few repositories will discuss pointers of structs and class and pointers of classes also.

Here is a quick review of the struct in details,
A structure is a user-defined data type in C/C++. A structure creates a data type that can be used to group items of possibly different types into a single type. //definition from Geeks for Geeks

struct structureName{
member;
};

Structures in C++ can contain two types of members:  

Data Member: These members are normal C++ variables. We can create a structure with variables of different data types in C++.
Member Functions: These members are normal C++ functions. Along with variables, we can also include functions inside a structure declaration.

To access the data inside the struct:

structureName ObjectFromStruct;
ObjectFromStruct.member = Value;
